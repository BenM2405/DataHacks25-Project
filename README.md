# DataHacks25-Project
In regards to the theme "Popular Culture" we decided on a project that focuses on the composition of Pok√©mon Soundtracks. Specifically, we trained a model to guess what genre and culture each games songs were based on. The model we used is called the Audio Spectagram Transformer Extractor (AST Extractor).
